          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            In Greek mythology, the Olympians were the major deities who Ancient
            Greeks believed in.
            <br />
            The Olympians were twelve and comprised of Zeus, Hera, Poseidon,
            Demeter, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Aphrodite, Hephaestus,
            Hermes and either Hestia or Dionysus.
            <br />
            Olympians originates from Mount Olympus, which was their place of
            residence; therefore, although sometimes Hades and Persephone were
            included in the Olympians, they should be excluded in the sense that
            they lived in the underworld.
            <br />
            The Twelve Olympians came into power after dethroning the Titans,
            which resulted after the end of the great war between the Olympians
            and the Titans, called the Titanomachy.

          <h2>Aphrodite</h2>
          <h3>Greek Goddess of Love and Beauty</h3>
          <p>
            Aphrodite is the Olympian goddess of love, beauty, sexual pleasure,
            and fertility. She is regularly attended by few of her children, the
            Erotes, who are capable of stirring up passion in both mortals and
            gods at the goddess' will.
            <br />
            Portrayed as both insatiable and unattainable, Aphrodite was born
            near the coast of Cythera out of the foam (aphros) Uranus' castrated
            genitals created when they fell into the sea.
            <br />
            Even though married to Hephaestus, she had affairs with all
            Olympians except Zeus and Hades, most famously with Ares, the god of
            war. She also had famous romances with two mortals, Anchises and
            Adonis.

        <section class="main-section" id="apollo">
          <h2>Apollo</h2>
          <h3>Greek God of the Sun and Light</h3>
          <p>
            Apollo is the Olympian god of the sun and light, music and poetry,
            healing and plagues, prophecy and knowledge, order and beauty,
            archery and agriculture.
            <br />
            An embodiment of the Hellenic ideal of kalokagathia, he is harmony,
            reason and moderation personified, a perfect blend of physical
            superiority and moral virtue.
            <br />
            A complex deity who turns up in art and literature possibly as often
            as Zeus himself, Apollo is the only major god who appears with the
            same name in both Greek and Roman mythology.

        <section class="main-section" id="ares">
          <h2>Ares</h2>
          <h3>Greek War God</h3>
          <p>
            Ares is the Olympian god of war. However, unlike Athena, he
            represents merely its destructive capacity and is typically the
            personification of sheer violence and brutality.
            <br />
            Consequently, he was loved neither by gods nor by men. That is, with
            the exception of Aphrodite, who bore him many children out of
            wedlock.

          <h2>Artemis</h2>
          <h3>Greek Goddess of the Hunt and the Moon</h3>
          <p>
            Artemis is the Olympian goddess of the hunt, the moon, and chastity;
            in time, she also became associated with childbirth and nature. No
            more than few days old, she helped her mother Leto give birth to her
            twin brother Apollo.
            <br />
            Artemis was very protective of her and her priestesses' innocence.
            Consequently, she wasn't very nice when some of them weren't so
            careful.

          <h2>Athena</h2>
          <h3>Greek Goddess of Wisdom and War</h3>
          <p>
            Athena is the Olympian goddess of wisdom and war and the adored
            patroness of the city of Athens. A virgin deity, she was also -
            somewhat paradoxically - associated with peace and handicrafts,
            especially spinning and weaving.
            <br />
            Majestic and stern, Athena surpassed everybody in both of her main
            domains. In fact, even Ares feared her; and all Greek heroes asked
            her for help and advice.

        <section class="main-section" id="hades">
          <h2>Hades</h2>
          <h3>Greek God of the Underworld</h3>
          <p>
            Hades is the Ancient Greek god of the Underworld, the place where
            human souls go after death. In time, his name became synonymous with
            his realm. It has to be said unsurprisingly - since he barely left
            it. Appropriately, the most significant myth related to Hades
            concerns one of the very few times he did - to abduct Demeter's
            daughter, Persephone.
            <br />
            Hades means “The Unseen One” - a suitable name since Hades is the
            ruler of the invisible world. However, the Ancient Greeks rarely
            used this name - just like Christians rarely used the word “Hell”
            during the Middle Ages.
            <br />
            So, since minerals and precious metals are found underground, they
            often referred to Hades euphemistically as Plouton - namely, “The
            Wealth-Giver.” Unsurprisingly, Hades' Roman equivalent is called
            Pluto as well.

          <h2>Hephaestus</h2>
          <h3>Greek God of Blacksmiths and Fire</h3>
          <p>
            Hephaestus is the god of blacksmiths and fire. Called “the celestial
            artificer,” he was also associated with other craftsmen (sculptors,
            carpenters, metalworkers) and, as evident in the name of his Roman
            counterpart Vulcan, with volcanoes. Even though an ugly god lamed by
            his own mother, he was the husband of none other than Aphrodite
            herself.
            <br />
            It is not known what the name Hephaestus means. However, since it’s
            similar to few pre-Greek toponyms (Phaistos), it is supposed that
            Hephaestus is a very old deity.

        <section class="main-section" id="hera">
          <h2>Hera</h2>
          <h3></h3>
          <p>
            Hera is the wife of Zeus, the Queen of Olympus, and the Olympian
            goddess of marriage. As such, she is also the deity most associated
            with family and the welfare of women and children. Her marriage,
            however, was an unhappy one, since Zeus had numerous affairs.
            Jealous and vengeful, Hera made sure to give each of his consorts
            some hard time.
            <br />Based on the number of cults, Hera was a very ancient goddess,
            possibly predating even Zeus. In fact, it's assumed that we don't
            even know her original name. “Hera” is actually a title, which is
            usually translated as “Lady” or “Mistress.” Hera's Roman counterpart
            was Juno, the goddess who gave her name to the month of June, even
            today, the most popular time for weddings.

          <h2>Hermes</h2>
          <h3>The Messenger of the Gods</h3>
          <p>
            Hermes is the winged herald and messenger of the Olympian gods. In
            addition, he is also a divine trickster, and the god of roads,
            flocks, commerce, and thieves. A precocious newborn, he invented the
            lyre and stole Apollo's cattle on the very first day of his life.
            Hermes was the only Olympian capable of crossing the border between
            the living and the dead.
            <br />
            Most scholars think that Hermes' name derives from the Greek word
            herma, which means “a heap of stones” or “cairn.” Cairns were a
            common sight in the Ancient world, serving as trail- or
            boundary-markers.
            <br />
            Some say that the first cairn was erected by the gods, when they
            cast all their stones in favor of Hermes, during his trial for
            slaying Argus Panoptes.

          <h2>Hestia</h2>
          <h3>Greek Goddess of the Hearth</h3>
          <p>
            Hestia is the Greek goddess of the hearth, one of the original
            Twelve Olympians. Cronus' and Rhea's first-born child, she was pure
            and peaceful. However, since she always had to stay at home, tending
            the fireplace, Hestia is not involved in many myths. Consequently,
            at a later stage, she would be replaced in the Pantheon with the
            much wilder Dionysus.
            <br />
            Hestia's name means “hearth” or “fireplace,” and her status shows
            how important the hearth was in the social and religious life of
            Ancient Greeks. Making and preserving fire was both essential and
            difficult for more primitive societies, which made the household
            fire a sacred element at a very early stage of history. In later
            days, Hestia became its embodiment.

          <h2>Poseidon</h2>
          <h3>Greek God of the Sea</h3>
          <p>
            Poseidon is the violent and ill-tempered god of the sea. One of the
            Twelve Olympians, he was also feared as the provoker of earthquakes
            and worshipped as the creator of the horse. A hot-blooded deity,
            Poseidon had many disputes with both gods and men, most famously
            with Athena and Odysseus.
            <br />
            Poseidon's name is very old, and its meaning is lost to us. Various
            authors have tried to translate it as either “husband of the earth”
            or “lord of the waters.” Plato says that it means “knower of many
            things,” but this is much less likely. Source:

          <h2>Zeus</h2>
          <h3>Greek God of the Sky and Thunder, King of the Gods</h3>
          <p>
            Zeus is the Olympian god of the sky and the thunder, the king of all
            other gods and men, and, consequently, the chief figure in Greek
            mythology. The son of Cronus and Rhea, he is probably most famous
            for his infidelity to his sister and wife, Hera.
            <br />
            Athena, Apollo and Artemis, Hermes, Dionysus, Heracles, Helen of
            Troy, and the Muses are all children of his numerous erotic affairs.
            Hephaestus, Hebe, and Ares are his legitimate children.
            <br />
            Zeus' name is thought to have originated from the Ancient Greek word
            for “bright.” The word has a close connection with dies, which is
            the Latin word for “day” and has a very ancient history. Therefore,
            many mythologists believe that Zeus is one of the oldest Greek gods.
